# About

This is a tool which creates Figma layouts using HTML and CSS.

This tool is based on the below repo.

https://github.com/sergcen/html-to-figma/tree/master

Due to security reasons, I need to separate the above repo into a Figma plugin and creating Figma layouts.

## How to use

1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. place input.txt which have HTML data
4. npm run start
